Two Methods implemented

1) Gradient based Approach
2) Intersection based Approach

Gradient based Approach
- Convert images to grayscale.
- Take the Sobel gradient in both x and y direction of all the background images.
- Take median of the gradient images along axis = 0 in both direction separately.
- Combine both the gradient images in x and y direction to get the extracted watermark.
- Find all the bounding box from the extracted watermark and ignore small bounding box (i.e. having height and width less than 30).
- Store the minimum and maximum coordinates from all the bounding box and make a bigger bounding box which is the probable location of the watermark.


Intersection based Approach
- Convert images to grayscale.
- Take the intersction such that if at a particular location in all the images if any of the pixel value is 255 then store 0 at that location else store 255.
- Find all the bounding box from the extracted watermark and ignore small bounding box (i.e. having height and width less than 30).
- Store the minimum and maximum coordinates from all the bounding box and make a bigger bounding box which is the probable location of the watermark.



Modified Gradient based Approach
- Convert images to grayscale.
- Take the Sobel gradient in both x and y direction of all the background images.
- Instead of taking median along axis = 0, we form seperate edge detected image of all the images using gradient images in both x and y direction.
- Take the intersection of all the edge detected images.
- Find all the bounding box from the extracted watermark and ignore small bounding box (i.e. having height and width less than 30).
- Store the minimum and maximum coordinates from all the bounding box and make a bigger bounding box which is the probable location of the watermark.


Removing watermark

- Dilate the bounding box of the watermark region.
- Replace the watermark by taking the extracted image as reference and by checking the
